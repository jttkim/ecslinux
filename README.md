This repository is to put together a Docker image to enable
students of the Engineering and Computer Science School of the
University of Hertfordshire to do practical work while being
physically away from the University.

This image so far provides:

* Editors: Emacs, Gedit, Vim
* Ocatve (Open Source Matlab-like system)
